## Title: Sales Forecasting Application Using Flask and Machine Learning

## Description:

Developed a sales forecasting application that predicts third-month sales based on features such as rate, sales for the first month, and sales for the second month. This project integrates a machine learning model with a Flask web application, showcasing skills in both backend development and machine learning.

## Key Responsibilities:

Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict third-month sales using historical sales data.
Developed a Flask application to serve the machine learning model, providing an API endpoint for predictions.
Preprocessed and analyzed sales data to extract relevant features for model training.
Implemented the API to accept input data (rate, first-month sales, second-month sales) and return the predicted third-month sales.
Deployed the Flask application, ensuring it is scalable and capable of handling multiple requests.
Conducted thorough testing to validate the model's accuracy and the API's reliability.
Technical Stack:

## Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (or any other ML framework), Python

Backend: Flask, Python
Frontend: HTML/CSS (if applicable)
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Deployment: Docker, AWS/GCP (or any other cloud service)
Data Formats: JSON

## Outcome:

Successfully developed and deployed a machine learning model within a Flask web application that predicts third-month sales based on provided features. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning models with web applications, emphasizing end-to-end development from data preprocessing and model training to API deployment.
